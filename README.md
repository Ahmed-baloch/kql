# <p align="center">Sentinel KQL</p>

In this repository you may find KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries and Watchlist schemes for data sources related to Microsoft Sentinel (a SIEM tool).

I will be commenting queries of the repository in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ep3p/status/1556248792269066241).

In the folder *Azure-Sentinel* you may find ***upgraded*** [Microsoft content from their repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel), that might not be worth to commit in that repository, where I have contributed [several pull requests](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aep3p) and I have appeared in their [Threat Hunters leaderboard](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Tools/stats/stats.md) (the scores have not been updated for several months).
